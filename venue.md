#Venue

While it may seem difficult, finding a venue to host CodeDay seems to be fairly straightforward. Try to contact: 

1. Co-working spaces and incubators/accelerators. They're usually the most flexible of any of the choices, and a good atmospheric fit.
2. Startups
3. Corporations
4. Your school

Unless you can track down major sponsorship, the venue needs to be free. So talking to conference centers and hotels is usually a waste of your time, as they almost always charge for event space.

Create a list of venues you think would be interested. See if you, or anyone you know, knows someone who works for them - a warm introduction goes a long way. Otherwise, don't be afraid to cold-call! Many venues are happy to help out students who want to get involved in technology. 

Once you've got someone on the phone or email, be sure to:

* Introduce yourself! Who are you? 
* Tell them what you're doing. You're looking to run a 24-hour programming marathon called CodeDay, which creates the next generation of technologists by getting students to work on tech projects. 
* Make the ask. Ask them to sponsor their space, allowing you to use it for 24 hours overnight. 
* Tell them why they benefit. They'll get the "Supporting Sponsor" level for free! Refer to the Sponsorships guide for more benefits. 

It may take some time, so even though a company says "we may be able to give you a space", keep looking until you get a yes. 

Once you get a yes, you're finished with one of the most important steps in organizing your CodeDay: getting a venue! 

###Space Checklist

Make sure your space has, or prepare to bring: 

* Enough chairs and tables
* Power outlets and extension strips
* A Projector
* Speakers for music (this is very important!)
