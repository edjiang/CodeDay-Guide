#Facilitating a CodeDay

Day Of
======
Start the event by giving an overview of CodeDay, then encourage students to pitch ideas for games or apps they want to build. It starts out slowly, but as soon as a few students pitch their cool ideas, more and more students will start participating. Write down these ideas. As soon as you feel like you have enough, take a straw poll (yelling or hands) to find the intriguing ideas. 

Highlight the leaders of the top ideas, and then have everyone mingle and form teams. This may seem like chaos, but it tends to work out decently well. About half of the attendees show up with a group of friends in mind, and the other half will either join the existing teams, or join the ideas. 

Serve pizza at this time. In the next few hours, the teams form, flesh out ideas, decide what technologies to use, and start coding. 

In an hour, start the workshops. Begin with the beginner workshops. That way, the beginners have something to do while their teams start out on the ideas. 

Stagger mini-events (dinner, swag giveaways, handing out soda/water, kareoke, etc) every few hours during CodeDay so that attendees feel excited and so that something's going on every once in a while. This helps with keeping students at the event and attrition low. 

At 9:00, judges should arrive. Have them go around and talk with the various teams about their projects. This is to get a feel for how "real" the games/apps are. 

At 10, presentations start. Each team gets 5 minutes to present about their project. Encourage everyone to present, and have a good laugh! 

At 11, judges deliberate about the various projects. Help give them context and guidance on how to judge, but don't help them decide. At the same time, have all the participants help clean up. 

At 11:30, present the awards and congratulate all the teams! Remind everyone that the event is over, but the connections, friendships, etc built at the event don't have to be! Encourage them to keep building cool stuff in the near future!
