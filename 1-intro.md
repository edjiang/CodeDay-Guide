#Why You Should Host a CodeDay

You know what the worst part of being a student programmer is?

Boredom.

Sure, you've done some cool projects, but how many have you abandoned before they were done because you got tired of them? Most students have folders of abandoned and unfinished projects because they got bored of them.

Why? As Tom Cargill from Bell put it:

> "The first 90% of the code accounts for 90% of the development time. The remaining 90% accounts for the other 90% of the development time."

**But you're going to change that.** CodeDay turns the solitary, endless goal of producing cool code into a frenzied 24-hour sprint to the finish. It's not just about the code, though, they're fun and social events where people produce virtual things, but have a good time together in real life!

A CodeDay is kind of like a party, version 2.0.

How To Use The Guide
--------------------

The CodeDay guide is your ultimate guide to planning and running a CodeDay event. The guide gives you a chronological overview of the work that needs to be done to ensure a fun and educational event.

We suggest you skim the entire guide, and then revisit each section as the time comes.

The CodeDay guide is intended to create a sort of hivemind of event organizers. We've tried a lot of things, and we know what's worked and what hasn't.

At the same time, we're constantly iterating on the CodeDay model. Your event is highly situational, so you'll have to tweak as you go. And when you do, **take notes!** At the end of the event, you'll be given access to add your own information to the guide.

Introduction to CodeDay
=======================

So, you've read the foreword and you're still interested in hosting a CodeDay? Awesome! It's a lot of hard work, but also a lot of fun. If you're still not 100% convinced, here are the top few reasons to organize:

1. Meet new friends and generally cool people; expand your network.
2. Start a community of cool and knowledgable people who can help you out in the future.
3. Build a cool culture of hackers in your community.
4. Gain experience organizing events.
5. People will love you. You will become famous*.

What it Takes
-------------

As it turns out, running a CodeDay is pretty difficult. (The best sort of organizers are the sort who take this as a challenge.) As an organizer, you're responsible for every aspect of the event:

 * Where and when will the CodeDay happen?
 * How will people find out about it?
 * Who can you get to sponsor it?
 * Who can you recruit? You need people to:
    * Set up chairs, tables, and the network
    * Clean up trash, restock toilet paper, etc
    * Pick up sandwiches/bagels/pizza
    * Manage the drinks
    * Make sure the network doesn't go down
 * Who else will help out? A successful event needs:
    * Mentors
    * Judges
    * Speakers

Don't get us wrong - it's actually a lot more fun than it might seem! But a successful event requires you to commit a lot of time and energy for several months. (Incedentally, the amount of work required increases exponentially as you get closer to the event, so don't plan a CodeDay the week after finals.)

Misconceptions
--------------

> "They don't think it be like it is but it do" -Oscar Gamble

 * You don't need to be amazing at Computer Science to run a CodeDay. You don't even need to know a ton about computers, though it helps.
 * You can participate in a CodeDay you helped organize if you recruit a big enough staff.
 * Being at a hackathon won't tell you everything you need to know to run one. A lot goes on behind the scenes.
 * For the first few CodeDays you organize, people will not just show up. You need to spend a lot of time on promotion.
 * The same goes for sponsorship. It takes time.

Philosophy of CodeDay
---------------------
Most competitions targeted at students are about winning awards for a resume. In fact, companies often sponsor them as lead-gen for getting interns.

CodeDay provides opportunities for students to do truly amazing things. Our events aren't about preparing to make something cool sometime in the future. **At CodeDays, students build amazing things.**

About StudentRND
-----------------

The CodeDay program is managed by StudentRND. StudentRND is a student-led 501(c)(3) non-profit company based out of Washington. It's not your standard company - if you couldn't tell from the name, it's founded and run entirely by students.

Our goal is to inspire students to learn more about science and technology. We do it in two simple ways:

  * Build a community of students who love science and tech
  * Make cool stuff

Students have a lot of potential, but there aren't many opportunities for them to reach that potential. 

Many students feel that in order to accomplish something, you have to know everything about it to do it:

> "If I don't study for a test, I will fail."

This sort of thinking might make sense if you're a doctor, or a bridge-builder, but in technology there's no reason not to figure it out on your own. StudentRND aims to change student thoughts to:

> "I don't know how to do something, but I can learn."
