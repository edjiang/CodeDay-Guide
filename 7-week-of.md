#Week Of

Marketing
---------
Keep promoting CodeDay! Many people buy tickets in the last week, and the prices go up right at Saturday midnight. Many people will procrastinate and buy as late as possible, so the early bird deadline is a great time to sell many many tickets! 

Many people decide to wait until the last minute, so don't worry! For CodeDay February, 3 people signed up before Saturday. After Saturday, 40 students signed up. By Friday night, we sold out of all 100 tickets! 

Server
------

Set up a file sharing server. The reasoning for this is two-fold:

  1. Some participants will have an aversion to source control.
  2. No matter how many times you warn them, almost everyone comes in missing their IDE of choice.

As a result of number 2, you'll want to download commonly used programs onto the server. Some we've noticed a need for in the past:

  * X-Code
  * Visual Studio 2010, and all the patches
  * XNA 4.0, and all the patches
  * Corona
  * Construct
  * GameMaker
  * pygame
  * **TBD: Others?**

If you fail in this step, your network **WILL** go down for the first few hours as everyone attempts to download the tools they need.

Food
----
Call the food vendors, and order food with the help of StudentRND. Go to your local grocery store and get breakfast and drinks.
