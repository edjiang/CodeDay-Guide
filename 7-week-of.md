
The Week Of
===========

Marketing
---------

Keep promoting CodeDay! Many people buy tickets in the last week, and the prices go up right at Saturday midnight. Many people will procrastinate and buy as late as possible, so the early bird deadline is a great time to sell many many tickets! 

Many people decide to wait until the last minute, so don't worry! For CodeDay February, 3 people signed up before Saturday. After Saturday, 40 students signed up. By Friday night, we sold out of all 100 tickets! 

Server
------

Set up a file sharing server.

No matter how many times you warn them, almost everyone comes in missing their IDE of choice. You'll want to download commonly used programs onto the server. There are some very simple ways to do this.

### VM

The simplest is to download our VM from [codeday.org/resources_vm.zip](http://codeday.org/resources_vm.zip). You can run this with VMware Player for free.

Boot up the VM on a good internet connection and wait; it will automatically sync the latest versions of popular tools from our Dropbox.

At the event, configure the VM for Bridged networking, and then boot it again. It will display the IP address once it's booted. If it won't boot in Bridged networking, set it to NAT and set up port forwarding for port 80. (How to do this is operating system-dependant, but it's easy to find instructions online on Google.)

### Roll Your Own

You can also install your own web server and either download all the tools yourself, or ask us to share the Dropbox folder with you.

### Integration With the CodeDay Site

Once you've got a file server running at the event, add the IP address in the Admin page of your CodeDay site. This will add a "Downloads" tab for your attendees. You'll need to remember to advertise its existance after the kickoff!

Email
-----

Eventbrite will send a generic "two days until your event" email, but attendees often have questions beyond "what day is CodeDay", so it's best to set up your own, as well. You can do this from the "Attendees" -> "Email Attendees" menu in Eventbrite. We've found it's best to schedule this email for 16 hours before the event.

### Information to Include

 * What to bring
   * Computer
   * Sleeping bag
   * Whatever you need to succeed (e.g. monitors)
   * Software
   * Ideas
 * What technologies you should use
   * Beginners should make a game in Construct
   * Advanced teams can use whatever they want
 * Install dev tools before you go
 * Location
 * When the doors open
 * Parking
 * Event schedule overview
 * Check-in procedure

We've provided a template for this email at [resources/pre-event-email.html.txt](resources/pre-event-email.html.txt), just be sure to change everything in brackets!

### Confirmations

You'll also want to send emails to anyone important who you haven't talked to in a while. This includes sponsors, speakers, judges, and your contact for the venue. Remind them of the event, and what time they'll be expected to show up and what to bring.

You should also make arrangements for getting access to the venue for setup.

Badges
------

The easiest way to do check-in is by pre-printing badges for all your attendees the night before the event. Since this results in a 1:1 mapping between an attendee and a badge, there's no need to use Eventbrite's At The Door feature to track no-shows and prevent people from sneaking in.

Badges are also awesome because they help new people remember names of people they just met.

You can pick up a 160-pack of self-adhesive Laser/Inkjet badges for around $25 at Staples. If you're going this route, design a template in Word, and mail-merge a CSV of attendees from Eventbrite. (The CodeDay admin site will eventually automate this.)

You can also hand-write the badges, either the night before, or at the door.

Having color-coded badges is also very helpful. We prefer to use red for attendees, green for volunteers, and blue for mentors, sponsors, speakers, and judges.

Food
----

Call the food vendors, and order food with the help of StudentRND. Go to your local grocery store and get breakfast and drinks. 

Setup
-----

The night before the event, get a bunch of volunteers together and get the event ready!

Things which should be handled the night before:

 * Equipment move-in
 * Tables
 * Chairs
 * Power, if you're not in an office or other space meant for lots of computers
 * Wifi
 * Drinks
 * Food area
 * Check-in table and badges
 * Audio
 * Projector
