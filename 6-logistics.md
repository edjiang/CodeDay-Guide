#Logistics

Food
----------
Budgeting is pretty simple. StudentRND will handle ticket sales & purchasing food for you, so you're not on the hook for thousands of dollars in expenses. You'll have to organize the food purchases. Most vendors will allow you to pay by phone, which we'll take care of for you. If you need to go to a grocery store (for drinks/fruit/etc), we'll reimburse you. 

The venue should be donated, and none of the organizers should be paid. That means the main costs are food. 

When ordering food, budget approximately: 

$2.50/person for lunch (pizza works well)
$5/person for dinner (sandwiches from Jimmy Johns or Subway)
$0.50/person for midnight snack (cup noodles)
$1.50/person for breakfast (fruit, muffins. For some reason, people aren't very hungry at breakfast)
$1.50/person for drinks (approx 4 cans + 4 bottles of water per person. We LOVE Safeway Soda!)

This adds up to about $12/person in expenses. 

Identify where you're looking to purchase from, and talk with them to make sure they can provide food at the price you want. Sometimes, local resturaunts will sponsor free food as well. 

Infrastructure
--------------
**Wifi**

Check to make sure that the venue wifi can support 50-100 students. If they've never tested it before, you might want to ask them to ensure they have 2-4 wifi routers covering the area. If they don't, or if they're really not sure, bring extra just in case. 

If you don't have extra to bring, you can request some free enterprise-grade routers from Meraki's [event wifi](http://www.meraki.com/company/event-wifi) program. 

**Ethernet**

There are always a few people who bring desktops to CodeDay, and there's a good chance those desktops won't have wifi cards.

We recommend setting up an area of the space for people needing wired connections. (If you're extremely lucky, your venue might have a lot of jacks already, in which case this point isn't relevant.)

Don't go overboard, though. In the past we've tried to provide ethernet to every participant, and in addition to being a nightmare to set up, few people used it.

**Server**

Find a computer with some extra space which won't be missed during the event. You'll want to set it up to run some servers in the coming weeks.

Logistics
---------

Logistics are the glue that hold an event together, and it is very important to make sure you are not missing any.

The list below covers cruicial resources that will make your CodeDay a success.

* Access to Space - How are you getting access to the space? Keycard? Key? Ask and make sure it will work for you.
* Chairs & Tables - Does your event location have chairs and tables for your event capacity? Many community centers may be able to loan you them if needed. 
* Power - Does your location have adequate power outlits and/or power strips. If not you may need to ask a community center for power. You will need at least one outlit per person.
* Parking - Does your event have free parking? If not how does overnight parking work? What are other options?
* Audio and Video - For all presentations (Workshops, speakers, and project presentations) do you have a screen/projector with HDMI & VGA/audio? A microphone?
* Documentation - Do you have someone that will take pictures? How will you record the presentations? (Laptop webcam works pretty well, should set it up with microphone though)
* Music - Make sure to bring speakers to have some awesome tunes
* Sleep - Not 100% necessary but if people want to sleep will there be a place for them?
