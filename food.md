#Food
Budgeting is pretty simple. StudentRND will handle ticket sales & purchasing food for you, so you're not on the hook for thousands of dollars in expenses. You'll have to organize the food purchases. Most vendors will allow you to pay by phone, which we'll take care of for you. If you need to go to a grocery store (for drinks/fruit/etc), we'll reimburse you. 

The venue should be donated, and none of the organizers should be paid. That means the main costs for CodeDay are food. 

When ordering food, budget approximately: 

$3/person for lunch (pizza)
$5/person for dinner (sandwiches from Jimmy Johns or Subway)
$0.50/person for midnight snack (cup noodles, donuts)
$1.00/person for breakfast (fruit, muffins. For some reason, people aren't very hungry at breakfast)
$1.50/person for drinks (approx 4 cans + 4 bottles of water per person. We LOVE Safeway Soda! Also, please get bottles. Spilling a cup is never fun at Codeday; bottles and cans make it more manageable.)

This adds up to about $12/person in expenses. If you get enough sponsorship, you can get nicer food as well. 

Identify where you're looking to purchase from, and talk with them to make sure they can provide food at the price you want. Sometimes, local resturaunts will sponsor free food as well.

Keep in mind, if you're serving any food which needs to be prepared, anyone involved will need to get a food handler permit. These are usually extremely fast and cheap to get, but the exact laws vary from state to state.
