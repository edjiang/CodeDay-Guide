
Speakers, Workshops, and Judges
===============================

Speakers
--------

CodeDay is about learning and having fun. A lot of the learning is learning-by-doing, but students still love the serendipity of listening to tech talks.

Finding potential speakers is easy - just contact people from the local tech community! More difficult - you'll want to make sure all your speakers capture participants' interest. Here are some examples of talks which went over well in the past:

  * Tech Entrepreneurship
  * Software Development Methodologies
  * Character Design
  * Gameplay Mechanics
  * Intro to Game Development with XNA

The best talks are interactive! Participants are taking time away from their projects; as a result they get quickly impatient with lecture-style talks. Ask your speakers to model their talks after tutorials. 

Make sure your speakers know what they're volunteering for. Here are some talking points:

  * You're hosting a hackathon for high school and college students on [[date]] and are looking for speakers
  * They students are very talented - this won't be a group of beginners
  * Give some examples of previous talks
  * Students often look to the speakers for advice, as well. If they have an extra hour or two to hang around, it's greatly appreciated.

If they're interested, reiterate the relevant details (time, date, location) and ask them what subject they're interested in talking about. Once you're done on the phone, send an email! Here's a template:

    Hey [name],

    I wanted to thank you again for agreeing to speak at CodeDay, a
    hackathon for high school and college students. I have you down on the
    schedule for [time] on [date] at [location]. I'm writing the title of
    your talk as [title] on the schedule, is that okay?

    When you're planning your talk, you should be aware of the fact that
    students are in the middle of developing games, and while the talks are
    extremely useful to them, they're often very impatient.

    As a result, we've found in the past that the talks work best when
    they're very interactive. As easy way to do this is to model it after
    a tutorial format.

    Thanks again for your help, and let me know if you have any questions.
    You can reach me here, or at [phone number].

    Cheers!

If you don't get a response within a few days, circle back with them. Everything needs to be confirmed as soon as possible.

Pre-event Workshops?
--------------------
Some CodeDays hold pre-event workshops for "beginners". This helps bring in people who think they don't know how to code well enough to participate. (In reality, many of these people ended up winning past CodeDays.)

If you choose to hold pre-event workshops, you'll need to book additional speakers (unless you run them yourself), a venue, and do more promotion. These have traditionally been free, but if you have budget issues that may be more open.

The Keynote
-----------
In addition to getting speakers for the workshops, you'll also need someone to give the **keynote** - a brief talk at the beginning of CodeDay which sets the tone and inspires everyone. You'll want to make sure your speaker is relevant to your audience, and that they're aware of the intentions of the talk. 

The keynote is an important component of attracting students to a CodeDay. Someone interesting and important speaking will encourage more students to click the "register" button, tell their friends, and be excited for the event. 

Judges
------
CodeDay is a competition, and a competition needs winners. A expert panel of judges goes a long way to boosting the legitimacy of the competition, and helps participants feel like they were treated fairly.

Judging panels at CodeDay are usually 3-5 people. Additionally, a volunteer usually sits in on the deliberation, to help the judges understand the criteria and to help where they may have questions. (Judging is covered in more detail later.)

Being a judge requires much less commitment than being a speaker, so you may have more success in getting highly qualified people.

The conversation with a potential judge should follow much the same format as with a potential speaker, except that you should stress the small time commitment necessary.

If you are having difficulty locating judges, you can ask speakers if they would be interested.

The following is an example of a confirmation email for a judge:

    Hey [name],

    I wanted to thank you again for agreeing to judge at CodeDay, a
    hackathon for high school and college students. As a reminder, the
    judging will be at [location] on [date] at [time]. Does that still
    work for you?

    You don't need to do any work beforehand, we will have instructions for
    you when you arrive.

    Thanks!
