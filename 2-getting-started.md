
Getting Started
===============

Meta
----
The very first thing you'll actually need to do is contact StudentRND. We'll get the website set up, get you what resources we can, and connect you with anyone we know in the area.

We'll also help you run the ticket sales page and directly pay the vendors. This makes your taxes and managing money easier! 

You can reach us at contact@studentrnd.org, or 425-780-7901 x2. Once that's done, you can move on to the actual work.

Volunteer Roles
---------------
Start a team of volunteers. You need to cover the following roles: 

 * The leader
 * The "day of" operations guy
 * Marketing/PR junkie
 * Sponsorships
 * Mentor/Speaker recruiter

The Date
---------
The most important part of a CodeDay is the people. Unfortunately, before you can even tell people about your event, it needs to have a date and a place.

How do you pick a date? Well,
  
  * Try to go for breaks: (President's Day (mid Feb), Memorial Day (late May), end-of-school/summer (June-Aug), or Veteran's day (mid Nov)). 
  * Don't compete with other tech events! Check Meetup and other local community resources, and black-out dates with competing events.
  * CodeDays are almost always on weekends, unless there's a break in school. Even then, weekends are preferrable for students who have jobs.
  * Check holiday calendars. Hosting a CodeDay during a school break has turned out extremely well, but we'd venture that it wouldn't work so well if it were on Christmas.
  * Don't schedule anywhere near exam times.
    * This includes the weeks before an after exams. This might seem like it's not a big deal, but trust us, it is.
    * Even if your school doesn't have exams that particular week, you run the risk of cutting your attendance dramatically.

The Place
---------

While it may seem difficult, finding a venue to host CodeDay seems to be fairly straightforward. Try to contact 

  1. Co-working spaces and incubators/accelerators. They're usually the most flexible of any of the choices, and a good atmospheric fit.
  2. Startup offices
  3. Corporate event spaces. 
  4. Your school. 

Unless you can track down major sponsorship (and trying to do so is usually a waste of time), the venue needs to be free. So talking to conference centers and hotels is usually a waste of your time.

All CodeDay venues need, at a minimum:

  * Needs to be large. For 100 people, you need 5,000 sq. ft. to be comfortable. Remember, they'll have computers, keyboards, and mice (and probably a stack of empty soda cans).
  * Needs to be somewhat open. If you give each team their own room, you are guarenteeing that no new connections will be made. (On the other hand, if you can, avoid having everyone in one big room. It gets loud.)
  * Fast and reliable internet. (It will probably still go down.)
  * Electricity. If you're not using a space designed for computers, you'll probably run into a blown breaker at some point. We'll cover avoiding this later.
  * Open all night. Again, it's a 24-hour marathon.

Get a list of venues you think would be interested. See if you, or anyone you know, knows someone who works for them - a warm introduction goes a long way. Otherwise, don't be afraid to cold-call! Many venues are happy to help out students who want to get involved in technology. 

Once you've got someone on the phone, here are some talking points:

  * CodeDay is run by a 501(c)(3) non-profit. (Make sure you specify 501(c)(3). There are other types, but working with a 501(c)(3) may have tax benefits for them, and they can often use it for positive press.)
  * They will be helping students interested in tech. If they're a tech company, you can play up the recruitment benefits.
  * They'll be listed as a sponsor on marketing materials and the website.
  * This promotes a healthy tech ecosystem in your community.
  * Your staff will take care of set-up, maintenance, and clean-up for the duration of the event.
  * Make sure to be clear on these points:
    * CodeDay is 24 hours, and closer to 30 if you count set-up, judging, and clean-up. It needs to be open all night.
    * You need internet access for 100 people.
    * There are no fees. The venue needs to be totally free. This includes power and security fees.

Once you've determined that a venue is interested in working with you, you'll need to figure out the specifics. This is why we suggested finding a list of dates which work in the previous step.

When you find a venue who's interested, make sure it's confirmed. You wouldn't want the venue to back out with everyone outside! Send an email to the venue similar to this:

    Hey [name],

    I just wanted to thank you again for donating your space for us to use
    from [time] on [date] to [time] on [date] for free!

    Just to remind you, this is an overnight event for programmers. We'll
    need 24-hour access to the space, as well as internet and electricity
    for 100 people. We will handle the set-up an clean-up.

    In return, we'll be listing you as a sponsor on our marketing materials
    and website.

    If you can quickly confirm this is all correct, we'll be able to start
    promoting this to local high school and college students.

    Again, we're really excited to be working with [company] on this!

    Thanks,
    [your name]
    CodeDay [city] Organizer

Got a confirmation? Congratulations, you're done with one of the hardest parts! On to the cooler bits!
