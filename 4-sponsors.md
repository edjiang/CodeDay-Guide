#Getting Sponsors

Sponsors make for awesome CodeDay events. While many people see sponsors as a way to get extra money for an event, they'll help you in so many more ways. For example, sponsors can help provide:

  * Credibility (What's CodeDay? Oh, COOLCORPORATION is involved? Awesome, sounds cool!)
  * Visibility (Helping you with PR, pushing out to their employees and social media)
  * Money
  * Swag & prizes
  * Mentors

The only question is, why would a company want to sponsor CodeDay? Sponsoring CodeDay benefits companies in many ways: 

 * Promote their product (eg, make apps for XYZPHONE! Drink XYZDRINK! )
 * Recruit passionate, motivated employees (eg, what's cooler than coding for 24 hours? Working for us!)
 * Supporting the community (many adults are parents/want to have kids, and want their kids to be in a great environment)

##Create a target list

When first looking for sponsorships, put together a list of companies you want to approach. These companies could be local tech companies or startups, engineering firms, resturaunts, and more. 

You could also look at these events to see who's sponsoring in your city: 

* Startup Weekend/Hackathons
* Robotics tournaments
* Business conferences

If anyone you know has a connection to one of those companies, have them introduce you to them. Otherwise, call them or send an email asking for a sponsorship. Tell them what CodeDay is, and why you're looking for sponsors and how it can help them. 

When they express interest, send them to [link], detailing the sponsorship levels. If they're interested, have them follow up with the StudentRND team so we can process their payment. 

If they're looking for a custom package, you're free to build something custom. Just make sure that it's fair to the other sponsors. 

##Creating value for sponsors

Once you've lined up a sponsor, make sure that you help them make their sponsorship a success! Keep communicating with them every other week until the event -- and make sure you help them leverage their sponsorship effectively! That means:

* Educating them about CodeDay culture, and how to promote their brand effectively
* Talking with them about tabling/swag plans, employee presence, etc. 
* What to present at CodeDay (present something actionable and inspiring -- not something that's interesting but not relevant to CodeDay)
* 
* ##Have fun!
* 
* After you secure several sponsors, you're well on your way to making CodeDay a success!
