#Getting Sponsors

Sponsorships
------------

Sponsors make for awesome CodeDay events. While many people see sponsors as a way to get extra money for an event, they'll help you in so many more ways. For example, sponsors can help provide:

  * Credibility (What's CodeDay? Oh, COOLCORPORATION is involved? Awesome, sounds cool!)
  * Visibility (Helping you with PR, pushing out to their employees and social media)
  * Money
  * Swag & prizes
  * Mentors

The only question is, why would a company want to sponsor CodeDay? Sponsoring CodeDay benefits companies in many ways: 

 * Promote their product (eg, make apps for XYZPHONE! Drink XYZDRINK! )
 * Recruit passionate, motivated employees (eg, what's cooler than coding for 24 hours? Working for us!)
 * Supporting the community (many adults are parents/want to have kids, and want their kids to be in a great environment)

When first looking for sponsorships, put together a list of companies you want to approach. For example, you may include local companies, companies that have sponsored other CodeDays, Startup Weekends, or similar events. 

If anyone you know has a connection to one of those companies, have them introduce you to them. Otherwise, call them or send an email asking for a sponsorship. Be prepared with what you want to ask them to do. It helps to have some predefined "sponsor packages" to cater to different sponsors.
