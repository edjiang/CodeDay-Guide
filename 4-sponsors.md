#Getting Sponsors

Sponsorships
------------

Sponsors make for awesome CodeDay events. While many people see sponsors as a way to get extra money for an event, they'll help you in so many more ways. For example, sponsors can help provide:

  * Credibility (What's CodeDay? Oh, COOLCORPORATION is involved? Awesome, sounds cool!)
  * Visibility (Helping you with PR, pushing out to their employees and social media)
  * Money
  * Swag & prizes
  * Mentors

The only question is, why would a company want to sponsor CodeDay? Sponsoring CodeDay benefits companies in many ways: 

 * Promote their product (eg, make apps for XYZPHONE! Drink XYZDRINK! )
 * Recruit passionate, motivated employees (eg, what's cooler than coding for 24 hours? Working for us!)
 * Supporting the community (many adults are parents/want to have kids, and want their kids to be in a great environment)

When first looking for sponsorships, put together a list of companies you want to approach. For example, you may include local companies, companies that have sponsored other CodeDays, Startup Weekends, or similar events. 

If anyone you know has a connection to one of those companies, have them introduce you to them. Otherwise, call them or send an email asking for a sponsorship. Be prepared with what you want to ask them to do. It helps to have some predefined "sponsor packages" to cater to different sponsors. 

Here's some sample packages for a ~60 person event: 

Presenting Sponsor ($1,000 + prize)
 * All of the below, plus:
 * Be able to give a custom prize (prize is extra)

Sponsor ($500)
 * Get recognition at the CodeDay website, opening, and closing events!
 * Put your Job Information at CodeDay!
 * Get a list of opt-in emails from students looking for internships

In-Kind Sponsor (swag, mentors, etc)

The best way to get sponsorships is to find connections in your network to local companies with some relation to tech. Again, warm introductions are ideal, but cold calling is better than nothing, and works more than you might think.
