Foreword
========

You know what the worst part of being a student programmer is?

Boredom.

Sure, you've done some cool projects, but how many have you abandoned before they were done because you got tired of them? Most students have folders of abandoned and unfinished projects because they got bored of them.

Why? As Tom Cargill from Bell put it:

> "The first 90% of the code accounts for 90% of the development time. The remaining 90% accounts for the other 90% of the development time."

**But you're going to change that.** CodeDay turns the solitary, endless goal of producing cool code into a frenzied 24-hour sprint to the finish. It's not just about the code, though, they're fun and social events where people produce virtual things, but have a good time together in real life!

A CodeDay is kind of like a party, version 2.0.

How To Use The Guide
--------------------

The CodeDay guide is your ultimate guide to planning and running a CodeDay event. The guide gives you a chronological overview of the work that needs to be done to ensure a fun and educational event.

We suggest you skim the entire guide, and then revisit each section as the time comes.

The CodeDay guide is intended to create a sort of hivemind of event organizers. We've tried a lot of things, and we know what's worked and what hasn't.

At the same time, we're constantly iterating on the CodeDay model. Your event is highly situational, so you'll have to tweak as you go. And when you do, **take notes!** At the end of the event, you'll be given access to add your own information to the guide.

Introduction to CodeDay
=======================

So, you've read the foreword and you're still interested in hosting a CodeDay? Awesome! It's a lot of hard work, but also a lot of fun. If you're still not 100% convinced, here are the top few reasons to organize:

1. Meet new friends and generally cool people; expand your network.
2. Start a community of cool and knowledgable people who can help you out in the future.
3. Build a cool culture of hackers in your community.
4. Gain experience organizing events.
5. People will love you. You will become famous*.

CodeDay Format
--------------

* Best Web App
* Most Creative
* Most Useful
* Most Innovative
* Funniest Presentation

What it Takes
-------------

As it turns out, running a CodeDay is pretty difficult. (The best sort of organizers are the sort who take this as a challenge.) As an organizer, you're responsible for every aspect of the event:

 * Where and when will the CodeDay happen?
 * How will people find out about it?
 * Who can you get to sponsor it?
 * Who can you recruit? You need people to:
    * Set up chairs, tables, and the network
    * Clean up trash, restock toilet paper, etc
    * Pick up sandwiches/bagels/pizza
    * Manage the drinks
    * Make sure the network doesn't go down
 * Who else will help out? A successful event needs:
    * Mentors
    * Judges
    * Speakers

Don't get us wrong - it's actually a lot more fun than it might seem! But a successful event requires you to commit a lot of time and energy for several months. (Incedentally, the amount of work required increases exponentially as you get closer to the event, so don't plan a CodeDay the week after finals.)

Misconceptions
--------------

> "They don't think it be like it is but it do" -Oscar Gamble

 * You don't need to be amazing at Computer Science to run a CodeDay. You don't even need to know a ton about computers, though it helps.
 * You can participate in a CodeDay you helped organize if you recruit a big enough staff.
 * Being at a hackathon won't tell you everything you need to know to run one. A lot goes on behind the scenes.
 * For the first few CodeDays you organize, people will not just show up. You need to spend a lot of time on promotion.
 * The same goes for sponsorship. It takes time.

Philosophy of CodeDay
---------------------
Most competitions targeted at students are about winning awards for a resume. In fact, companies often sponsor them as lead-gen for getting interns.

CodeDay provides opportunities for students to do truly amazing things. Our events aren't about preparing to make something cool sometime in the future. **At CodeDays, students build amazing things.**

About StudentRND
-----------------

The CodeDay program is managed by StudentRND. StudentRND is a student-led 501(c)(3) non-profit company based out of Washington. It's not your standard company - if you couldn't tell from the name, it's founded and run entirely by students.

Our goal is to inspire students to learn more about science and technology. We do it in two simple ways:

  * Build a community of students who love science and tech
  * Make cool stuff

Students have a lot of potential, but there aren't many opportunities for them to reach that potential. 

Many students feel that in order to accomplish something, you have to know everything about it to do it:

> "If I don't study for a test, I will fail."

This sort of thinking might make sense if you're a doctor, or a bridge-builder, but in technology there's no reason not to figure it out on your own. StudentRND aims to change student thoughts to:

> "I don't know how to do something, but I can learn."


3 Months Out: Contact Businesses
================================

Meta
----
The very first thing you'll actually need to do is contact StudentRND. We'll get the website set up, get you what resources we can, and connect you with anyone we know in the area.

We'll also help you run the ticket sales page and directly pay the vendors. This makes your taxes and managing money easier! 

You can reach us at contact@studentrnd.org. Once that's done, you can move on to the actual work.

Volunteer Roles
---------------
Start a team of volunteers. You need to cover the following roles: 

 * The leader
 * The "day of" operations guy
 * Marketing/PR junkie
 * Sponsorships
 * Mentor/Speaker recruiter

The Date
---------
The most important part of a CodeDay is the people. Unfortunately, before you can even tell people about your event, it needs to have a date and a place.

How do you pick a date? Well,
  
  * Try to go for breaks: (President's Day (mid Feb), Memorial Day (late May), end-of-school/summer (June-Aug), or Veteran's day (mid Nov)). 
  * Don't compete with other tech events! Check Meetup and other local community resources, and black-out dates with competing events.
  * CodeDays are almost always on weekends, unless there's a break in school. Even then, weekends are preferrable for students who have jobs.
  * Check holiday calendars. Hosting a CodeDay during a school break has turned out extremely well, but we'd venture that it wouldn't work so well if it were on Christmas.
  * Don't schedule anywhere near exam times.
    * This includes the weeks before an after exams. This might seem like it's not a big deal, but trust us, it is.
    * Even if your school doesn't have exams that particular week, you run the risk of cutting your attendance dramatically.

The Place
---------

While it may seem difficult, finding a venue to host CodeDay seems to be fairly straightforward. Try to contact 

  1. Co-working spaces and incubators/accelerators. They're usually the most flexible of any of the choices, and a good atmospheric fit.
  2. Startup offices
  3. Corporate event spaces. 
  4. Your school. 

Unless you can track down major sponsorship (and trying to do so is usually a waste of time), the venue needs to be free. So talking to conference centers and hotels is usually a waste of your time.

All CodeDay venues need, at a minimum:

  * Needs to be large. For 100 people, you need 5,000 sq. ft. to be comfortable. Remember, they'll have computers, keyboards, and mice (and probably a stack of empty soda cans).
  * Needs to be somewhat open. If you give each team their own room, you are guarenteeing that no new connections will be made. (On the other hand, if you can, avoid having everyone in one big room. It gets loud.)
  * Fast and reliable internet. (It will probably still go down.)
  * Electricity. If you're not using a space designed for computers, you'll probably run into a blown breaker at some point. We'll cover avoiding this later.
  * Open all night. Again, it's a 24-hour marathon.

Get a list of venues you think would be interested. See if you, or anyone you know, knows someone who works for them - a warm introduction goes a long way. Otherwise, don't be afraid to cold-call! Many venues are happy to help out students who want to get involved in technology. 

Once you've got someone on the phone, here are some talking points:

  * CodeDay is run by a 501(c)(3) non-profit. (Make sure you specify 501(c)(3). There are other types, but working with a 501(c)(3) may have tax benefits for them, and they can often use it for positive press.)
  * They will be helping students interested in tech. If they're a tech company, you can play up the recruitment benefits.
  * They'll be listed as a sponsor on marketing materials and the website.
  * This promotes a healthy tech ecosystem in your community.
  * Your staff will take care of set-up, maintenance, and clean-up for the duration of the event.
  * Make sure to be clear on these points:
    * CodeDay is 24 hours, and closer to 30 if you count set-up, judging, and clean-up. It needs to be open all night.
    * You need internet access for 100 people.
    * There are no fees. The venue needs to be totally free. This includes power and security fees.

Once you've determined that a venue is interested in working with you, you'll need to figure out the specifics. This is why we suggested finding a list of dates which work in the previous step.

When you find a venue who's interested, make sure it's confirmed. You wouldn't want the venue to back out with everyone outside! Send an email to the venue similar to this:

    Hey [name],

    I just wanted to thank you again for donating your space for us to use
    from [time] on [date] to [time] on [date] for free!

    Just to remind you, this is an overnight event for programmers. We'll
    need 24-hour access to the space, as well as internet and electricity
    for 100 people. We will handle the set-up an clean-up.

    In return, we'll be listing you as a sponsor on our marketing materials
    and website.

    If you can quickly confirm this is all correct, we'll be able to start
    promoting this to local high school and college students.

    Again, we're really excited to be working with [company] on this!

    Thanks,
    [your name]
    CodeDay [city] Organizer

Got a confirmation? Congratulations, you're done with one of the hardest parts! On to the cooler bits!

Promotion
---------

The single biggest task in planning a CodeDay is making sure people come. Students are skeptical, busy people, and it takes quite a bit of convincing to get them to leave what they're doing for an entire weekend, especially if this is the first CodeDay in the area.

**Promote early.** As soon as you have a venue and a date you should be promoting.

Here's a good roadmap for early promotion.

  1. Create events on Facebook, Meetup, and others. Make sure people know they need to get tickets from the CodeDay website. 

  2. Identify some community leaders. This means trend-setting students, club leaders, etc. Ask them to commit to attending CodeDay. Give them a free ticket if they promise to help you promote the event on Facebook/Twitter/etc. Having these students attend ensures that their friends and others that they inspire will attend as well. 

  3. Contact your friends. Go through your entire list of friends on Facebook, and message each one that you think are interested in programming, gaming, art, and entrepreneurship. 

  Make it clear why this is going to be amazing. Promotion works best early on when you have a group of people who love you so much that they convince other people to come as well.

  4. Find some Facebook groups and email lists to join, and promote it on there. Examples are: CS / Programming groups, CSTA (Computer Science Teachers Association) mailing lists, FIRST Robotics, Math clubs, etc. 

  5. Talk to local schools. Ask them to hand out flyers, and see if you can visit their classes to speak for 5 minutes.

  Emphasize the educational benefits, and see if they'll offer extra credit. Have them commit to a specific time they'll tell their students, and remind them of it. Teachers are often busy and may forget.

  6. Contact some local newspapers. They usually have contact information on their websites. 

  7. Post updates on social media sites every day until the event.

Speakers
--------

CodeDay is about learning and having fun. A lot of the learning is learning-by-doing, but students still love the serendipity of listening to tech talks.

Finding potential speakers is easy - just contact people from the local tech community! More difficult - you'll want to make sure all your speakers capture participants' interest. Here are some examples of talks which went over well in the past:

  * Tech Entrepreneurship
  * Software Development Methodologies
  * Character Design
  * Gameplay Mechanics
  * Intro to Game Development with XNA

The best talks are interactive! Participants are taking time away from their projects; as a result they get quickly impatient with lecture-style talks. Ask your speakers to model their talks after tutorials. 

Make sure your speakers know what they're volunteering for. Here are some talking points:

  * You're hosting a hackathon for high school and college students on [[date]] and are looking for speakers
  * They students are very talented - this won't be a group of beginners
  * Give some examples of previous talks
  * Students often look to the speakers for advice, as well. If they have an extra hour or two to hang around, it's greatly appreciated.

If they're interested, reiterate the relevant details (time, date, location) and ask them what subject they're interested in talking about. Once you're done on the phone, send an email! Here's a template:

    Hey [name],

    I wanted to thank you again for agreeing to speak at CodeDay, a
    hackathon for high school and college students. I have you down on the
    schedule for [time] on [date] at [location]. I'm writing the title of
    your talk as [title] on the schedule, is that okay?

    When you're planning your talk, you should be aware of the fact that
    students are in the middle of developing games, and while the talks are
    extremely useful to them, they're often very impatient.

    As a result, we've found in the past that the talks work best when
    they're very interactive. As easy way to do this is to model it after
    a tutorial format.

    Thanks again for your help, and let me know if you have any questions.
    You can reach me here, or at [phone number].

    Cheers!
    [name]
    CodeDay [city] Organizer

If you don't get a response within a few days, circle back with them. Everything needs to be confirmed as soon as possible.

Pre-event Workshops?
--------------------
Some CodeDays hold pre-event workshops for "beginners". This helps bring in people who think they don't know how to code well enough to participate. (In reality, many of these people ended up winning past CodeDays.)

If you choose to hold pre-event workshops, you'll need to book additional speakers (unless you run them yourself), a venue, and do more promotion. These have traditionally been free, but if you have budget issues that may be more open.

The Keynote
-----------
In addition to getting speakers for the workshops, you'll also need someone to give the **keynote** - a brief talk at the beginning of CodeDay which sets the tone and inspires everyone. You'll want to make sure your speaker is relevant to your audience, and that they're aware of the intentions of the talk. 

The keynote is an important component of attracting students to a CodeDay. Someone interesting and important speaking will encourage more students to click the "register" button, tell their friends, and be excited for the event. 

Judges
------
CodeDay is a competition, and a competition needs winners. A expert panel of judges goes a long way to boosting the legitimacy of the competition, and helps participants feel like they were treated fairly.

Judging panels at CodeDay are usually 3-5 people. Additionally, a volunteer usually sits in on the deliberation, to help the judges understand the criteria and to help where they may have questions. (Judging is covered in more detail later.)

Being a judge requires much less commitment than being a speaker, so you may have more success in getting highly qualified people.

The conversation with a potential judge should follow much the same format as with a potential speaker, except that you should stress the small time commitment necessary.

If you are having difficulty locating judges, you can ask speakers if they would be interested.

The following is an example of a confirmation email for a judge:

    Hey [name],

    I wanted to thank you again for agreeing to judge at CodeDay, a
    hackathon for high school and college students. As a reminder, the
    judging will be at [location] on [date] at [time]. Does that still
    work for you?

    You don't need to do any work beforehand, we will have instructions for
    you when you arrive.

    Thanks!
    [name]
    CodeDay [city] Organizer

Sponsorships
------------

Sponsors make for awesome CodeDay events. While many people see sponsors as a way to get extra money for an event, they'll help you in so many more ways. For example, sponsors can help provide:

  * Credibility (What's CodeDay? Oh, COOLCORPORATION is involved? Awesome, sounds cool!)
  * Visibility (Helping you with PR, pushing out to their employees and social media)
  * Money
  * Swag & prizes
  * Mentors

The only question is, why would a company want to sponsor CodeDay? Sponsoring CodeDay benefits companies in many ways: 

 * Promote their product (eg, make apps for XYZPHONE! Drink XYZDRINK! )
 * Recruit passionate, motivated employees (eg, what's cooler than coding for 24 hours? Working for us!)
 * Supporting the community (many adults are parents/want to have kids, and want their kids to be in a great environment)

When first looking for sponsorships, put together a list of companies you want to approach. For example, you may include local companies, companies that have sponsored other CodeDay, Startup Weekends, or similar events. 

If anyone you know has a connection to one of those companies, have them introduce you to them. Otherwise, call them or send an email asking for a sponsorship. Be prepared with what you want to ask them to do. It helps to have some predefined "sponsor packages" to cater to different sponsors. 

Here's some sample packages for a ~60 person event: 

Presenting Sponsor ($1,000 + prize)
 * All of the below, plus:
 * Be able to give a custom prize (prize is extra)

Sponsor ($500)
 * Get recognition at the CodeDay website, opening, and closing events!
 * Put your Job Information at CodeDay!
 * Get a list of opt-in emails from students looking for internships

In-Kind Sponsor (swag, mentors, etc)

The best way to get sponsorships is to find connections in your network to local companies with some relation to tech. Again, warm introductions are ideal, but cold calling is better than nothing, and works more than you might think.

1-2 Months Out: Planning and More Promotion
========================================

Promotion
---------
By now you should have a fair number of speakers and sponsors lined up. Promote this! Especially if this is your first CodeDay, having professionals and companies on board gives the event more legitimacy.

Food
----------
Budgeting is pretty simple. StudentRND will handle ticket sales & purchasing food for you, so you're not on the hook for thousands of dollars in expenses. You'll have to organize the food purchases. Most vendors will allow you to pay by phone, which we'll take care of for you. If you need to go to a grocery store (for drinks/fruit/etc), we'll reimburse you. 

The venue should be donated, and none of the organizers should be paid. That means the main costs are food. 

When ordering food, budget approximately: 

$2.50/person for lunch (pizza works well)
$5/person for dinner (sandwiches from Jimmy Johns or Subway)
$0.50/person for midnight snack (cup noodles)
$1.50/person for breakfast (fruit, muffins. For some reason, people aren't very hungry at breakfast)
$1.50/person for drinks (approx 4 cans + 4 bottles of water per person. We LOVE Safeway Soda!)

This adds up to about $12/person in expenses. 

Identify where you're looking to purchase from, and talk with them to make sure they can provide food at the price you want. Sometimes, local resturaunts will sponsor free food as well. 

Infrastructure
--------------
**Wifi**

You should never need to buy Wifi access points; even if you don't have spares, someone you know probably does. (Worst case, you can get them for ~$5 at a local thrift store.) These do not need to be good, they just need to work.

Track down and, if needed, get a commitment to let you borrow, at least one wifi router per 25 people at the event. People being unable to get on the internet is bad. People being unable to share files locally is *terrible*.

**Ethernet**

There are always a few people who bring desktops to CodeDay, and there's a good chance those desktops won't have wifi cards.

We recommend setting up an area of the space for people needing wired connections. (If you're extremely lucky, your venue might have a lot of jacks already, in which case this point isn't relevant.)

Don't go overboard, though. In the past we've tried to provide ethernet to every participant, and in addition to being a nightmare to set up, few people used it.

Count on borrowing a 16-port switch, or be very clear in your marketing that wifi is required.

**Server**

Find a computer with some extra space which won't be missed during the event. You'll want to set it up to run some servers in the coming weeks.

Logistics
---------

Logistics are the glue that hold an event together, and it is very important to make sure you are not missing any.

The list below covers cruicial resources that will make your CodeDay a success.

* Access to Space - How are you getting access to the space? Keycard? Key? Ask and make sure it will work for you.
* Chairs & Tables - Does your event location have chairs and tables for your event capacity? Many community centers may be able to loan you them if needed. 
* Power - Does your location have adequate power outlits and/or power strips. If not you may need to ask a community center for power. You will need at least one outlit per person.
* Parking - Does your event have free parking? If not how does overnight parking work? What are other options?
* Audio and Video - For all presentations (Workshops, speakers, and project presentations) do you have a screen/projector with HDMI & VGA/audio? A microphone?
* Documentation - Do you have someone that will take pictures? How will you record the presentations? (Laptop webcam works pretty well, should set it up with microphone though)
* Music - Make sure to bring speakers to have some awesome tunes
* Sleep - Not 100% necessary but if people want to sleep will there be a place for them?


One Week Out: Get It Together
=============================

Marketing
---------
Keep promoting CodeDay! Many people buy tickets in the last week, and the prices go up right at Saturday midnight. Many people will procrastinate and buy as late as possible, so the early bird deadline is a great time to sell many many tickets! 

Many people decide to wait until the last minute, so don't worry! For CodeDay February, 3 people signed up before Saturday. After Saturday, 40 students signed up. By Friday night, we sold out of all 100 tickets! 

Server
------

Set up a file sharing server. The reasoning for this is two-fold:

  1. Some participants will have an aversion to source control.
  2. No matter how many times you warn them, almost everyone comes in missing their IDE of choice.

As a result of number 2, you'll want to download commonly used programs onto the server. Some we've noticed a need for in the past:

  * X-Code
  * Visual Studio 2010, and all the patches
  * XNA 4.0, and all the patches
  * Corona
  * Construct
  * GameMaker
  * pygame
  * **TBD: Others?**

If you fail in this step, your network **WILL** go down for the first few hours as everyone attempts to download the tools they need.

Food
----
Call the food vendors, and order food with the help of StudentRND. Go to your local grocery store and get breakfast and drinks. 

Day Before: Collection and Setup
=================================
TBD

Day Of
======
Start the event by giving an overview of CodeDay, then encourage students to pitch ideas for games or apps they want to build. It starts out slowly, but as soon as a few students pitch their cool ideas, more and more students will start participating. Write down these ideas. As soon as you feel like you have enough, take a straw poll (yelling or hands) to find the intriguing ideas. 

Highlight the leaders of the top ideas, and then have everyone mingle and form teams. This may seem like chaos, but it tends to work out decently well. About half of the attendees show up with a group of friends in mind, and the other half will either join the existing teams, or join the ideas. 

Serve pizza at this time. In the next few hours, the teams form, flesh out ideas, decide what technologies to use, and start coding. 

In an hour, start the workshops. Begin with the beginner workshops. That way, the beginners have something to do while their teams start out on the ideas. 

Stagger mini-events (dinner, swag giveaways, handing out soda/water, kareoke, etc) every few hours during CodeDay so that attendees feel excited and so that something's going on every once in a while. This helps with keeping students at the event and attrition low. 

At 9:00, judges should arrive. Have them go around and talk with the various teams about their projects. This is to get a feel for how "real" the games/apps are. 

At 10, presentations start. Each team gets 5 minutes to present about their project. Encourage everyone to present, and have a good laugh! 

At 11, judges deliberate about the various projects. Help give them context and guidance on how to judge, but don't help them decide. At the same time, have all the participants help clean up. 

At 11:30, present the awards and congratulate all the teams! Remind everyone that the event is over, but the connections, friendships, etc built at the event don't have to be! Encourage them to keep building cool stuff in the near future!
