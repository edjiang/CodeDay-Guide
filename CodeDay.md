Foreword
========

You know what the worst part of being a student programmer is?

Boredom.

Sure, you've done some cool projects, but how many have you abandoned before they were done because you got tired of them? Most students have folders of abandoned and unfinished projects because they got bored of them.

Why? As Tom Cargill from Bell put it:

> "The first 90% of the code accounts for 90% of the development time. The remaining 90% accounts for the other 90% of the development time."

**But you're going to change that.** CodeDay turns the solitary, endless goal of producing cool code into a frenzied 24-hour sprint to the finish. It's not just about the code, though, they're fun and social events where people produce virtual things, but have a good time together in real life!

A CodeDay is kind of like a party, version 2.0.

How To Use The Guide
--------------------

The CodeDay guide is your ultimate guide to planning and running a CodeDay event. The guide gives you a chronological overview of the work that needs to be done to ensure a fun and educational event.

We suggest you skim the entire guide, and then revisit each section as the time comes.

The CodeDay guide is intended to create a sort of hivemind of event organizers. We've tried a lot of things, and we know what's worked and what hasn't.

At the same time, we're constantly iterating on the CodeDay model. Your event is highly situational, so you'll have to tweak as you go. And when you do, **take notes!** At the end of the event, you'll be given access to add your own information to the guide.

Introduction to CodeDay
=======================

So, you've read the foreword and you're still interested in hosting a CodeDay? Awesome! It's a lot of hard work, but also a lot of fun. If you're still not 100% convinced, here are the top few reasons to organize:

1. Meet new friends and generally cool people; expand your network.
2. Start a community of cool and knowledgable people who can help you out in the future.
3. Build a cool culture of hackers in your community.
4. Gain experience organizing events.
5. People will love you. You will become famous*.

What it Takes
-------------

As it turns out, running a CodeDay is pretty difficult. (The best sort of organizers are the sort who take this as a challenge.) As an organizer, you're responsible for every aspect of the event:

 * Where and when will the CodeDay happen?
 * How will people find out about it?
 * Who can you get to sponsor it?
 * Who can you recruit? You need people to:
    * Set up chairs, tables, and the network
    * Clean up trash, restock toilet paper, etc
    * Pick up sandwiches/bagels/pizza
    * Manage the drinks
    * Make sure the network doesn't go down
 * Who else will help out? A successful event needs:
    * Mentors
    * Judges
    * Speakers

Don't get us wrong - it's actually a lot more fun than it might seem! But a successful event requires you to commit a lot of time and energy for several months. (Incedentally, the amount of work required increases exponentially as you get closer to the event, so don't plan a CodeDay the week after finals.)

Misconceptions
--------------

> "They don't think it be like it is but it do" -Oscar Gamble

 * You don't need to be amazing at Computer Science to run a CodeDay. You don't even need to know a ton about computers, though it helps.
 * You can participate in a CodeDay you helped organize if you recruit a big enough staff.
 * Being at a hackathon won't tell you everything you need to know to run one. A lot goes on behind the scenes.
 * For the first few CodeDays you organize, people will not just show up. You need to spend a lot of time on promotion.
 * The same goes for sponsorship. It takes time.

Philosophy of CodeDay
---------------------
Most competitions targeted at students are about winning awards for a resume. In fact, companies often sponsor them as lead-gen for getting interns.

CodeDay provides opportunities for students to do truly amazing things. Our events aren't about preparing to make something cool sometime in the future. **At CodeDays, students make amazing products.**

About StudentRND
-----------------

The CodeDay program is managed by StudentRND. StudentRND is a student-led 501(c)(3) non-profit company based out of Washington. It's not your standard company - if you couldn't tell from the name, it's founded and run entirely by students.

Our goal is to inspire students to learn more about science and technology. We do it in two simple ways:

  * Build a community of students who love science and tech
  * Make cool stuff

Students have a lot of potential, but there aren't many opportunities for them to reach that potential. 

Many students feel that in order to accomplish something, you have to know everything about it to do it:

> "If I don't study for a test, I will fail."

This sort of thinking might make sense if you're a doctor, or a bridge-builder, but in technology there's no reason not to figure it out on your own. StudentRND aims to change student thoughts to:

> "I don't know how to do something, but I can learn."


3-Months Out: Contact Businesses
================================

Meta
----
The very first thing you'll actually need to do is contact StudentRND. We'll get the website set up, get you what resources we can, and connect you with anyone we know in the area.

You can reach us at contact@studentrnd.org. Once that's done, you can move on to the actual work.

The Date
---------
The most important part of a CodeDay is the people. Unfortunately, before you can even tell people about your event, it needs to have a date and a place.

How do you pick a date? Well,

  * Don't compete with other tech events! Check Meetup and other local community resources, and black-out dates with competing events.
  * CodeDays are almost always on weekends, unless there's a break in school. Even then, weekends are preferrable for students who have jobs.
  * Check holiday calendars. Hosting a CodeDay during a school break has turned out extremely well, but we'd venture that it wouldn't work so well if it were on Christmas.
  * Don't schedule anywhere near exam times.
    * This includes the weeks before an after exams. This might seem like it's not a big deal, but trust us, it is.
    * Even if your school doesn't have exams that particular week, you run the risk of cutting your attendance dramatically.

The Place
---------

Unless you have your own location (like StudentRND does in Bellevue), you'll want to get a list of possible dates, because you'll need to find a venue to work with you.

Unfortunately, getting the venue is the second most-difficult part of organizing your first CodeDay. The only way to go about it is to contact lots of them. Here are some suggestions:

  1. Co-working spaces and incubators/accelerators. They're usually the most flexible of any of the choices, and a good atmospheric fit.
  2. Your school, if they're willing.
  3. Corporate event spaces. They often donate them.
  4. Startup offices.

Unless you can track down major sponsorship (and trying to do so is usually a waste of time), the venue needs to be free. So talking to conference centers and hotels is usually a waste of your time.

If you're using a space from a school, make sure there aren't any hidden fees, such as security or power. "Free" isn't always free for large institutions. Also, pay attention to the rules they might impose on use.

All CodeDay venues need, at a minimum:

  * Needs to be large. For 100 people, you need 3,500 sq. ft. to be comfortable. Remember, they'll have computers, keyboards, and mice (and probably a stack of empty soda cans).
  * Needs to be somewhat open. If you give each team their own room, you are guarenteeing that no new connections will be made. (On the other hand, if you can, avoid having everyone in one big room. It gets loud.)
  * Fast and reliable internet. (It will probably still go down.)
  * Electricity. If you're not using a space designed for computers, you'll probably run into a blown breaker at some point. We'll cover avoiding this later.
  * Open all night. Again, it's a 24-hour marathon.

Get a list of venues you think would be interested. See if you, or anyone you know, knows someone who works for them - a warm introduction goes a long way. Cold-calling is okay as a last resort.

Once you've got someone on the phone, here are some talking points:

  * CodeDay is run by a 501(c)(3) non-profit. (Make sure you specify 501(c)(3). There are other types, but working with a 501(c)(3) may have tax benefits for them, and they can often use it for positive press.)
  * They will be helping students interested in tech. If they're a tech company, you can play up the recruitment benefits.
  * They'll be listed as a sponsor on marketing materials and the website.
  * This promotes a healthy tech ecosystem in your community.
  * Your staff will take care of set-up, maintenance, and clean-up for the duration of the event.
  * Make sure to be clear on these points:
    * CodeDay is 24 hours, and closer to 30 if you count set-up, judging, and clean-up. It needs to be open all night.
    * You need internet access for 100 people.
    * There are no fees. The venue needs to be totally free. This includes power and security fees.

Once you've determined that a venue is interested in working with you, you'll need to figure out the specifics. This is why we suggested finding a list of dates which work in the previous step.

When you find a venue who's interested, make sure it's confirmed. You wouldn't want the venue to back out with everyone outside! Send an email to the venue similar to this:

    Hey [name],

    I just wanted to thank you again for donating your space for us to use
    from [time] on [date] to [time] on [date] for free!

    Just to remind you, this is an overnight event for programmers. We'll
    need 24-hour access to the space, as well as internet and electricity
    for 100 people. We will handle the set-up an clean-up.

    In return, we'll be listing you as a sponsor on our marketing materials
    and website.

    If you can quickly confirm this is all correct, we'll be able to start
    promoting this to local high school and college students.

    Again, we're really excited to be working with [company] on this!

    Thanks,
    [your name]
    CodeDay [city] Organizer

Got a confirmation? Congratulations, you're done with one of the hardest parts! On to the cooler bits!

Promotion
---------

The single biggest task in planning a CodeDay is making sure people come. Students are skeptical, busy people, and it takes quite a bit of convincing to get them to leave what they're doing for an entire weekend, especially if this is the first CodeDay in the area.

**Promote early.** As soon as you have a venue and a date you should be promoting.

Here's a good roadmap for early promotion.

  1. Contact your friends. Get them to commit to coming. Have them buy a ticket. Offer them a discount if needed. (Never free, though. Spending any amount of money on the ticket doubles the chance they'll show up.)

  Make it clear why this is going to be amazing. Promotion works best early on when you have a group of people who love you so much that they convince other people to come as well.

  2. Talk to local schools. Ask them to hand out flyers, and see if you can visit their classes to speak for 10 minutes.

  Emphasize the educational benefits, and see if they'll offer extra credit. Have them commit to a specific time they'll tell their students, and remind them of it. Teachers are often busy and may forget.

  3. Create events on Facebook, Meetup, and others. Make sure people know they need to get tickets from your website. Offer small discounts with a short time limit.

  4. Post updates on social media sites every day until the event.

Speakers
--------

CodeDay is about learning and having fun. A lot of the learning is learning-by-doing, but students still love the serendipity of listening to tech talks.

Finding potential speakers is easy - just contact people from the local tech community! More difficult - you'll want to make sure all your speakers capture participants' interest. Here are some examples of talks which went over well in the past:

  * Tech Entrepreneurship
  * Software Development Methodologies
  * Character Design
  * Gameplay Mechanics
  * Intro to Game Development with XNA

The best talks are interactive! Participants are taking time away from their projects; as a result they get quickly impatient with lecture-style talks. Ask your speakers to model their talks after tutorials.

Make sure your speakers know what they're volunteering for. Here are some talking points:

  * You're hosting a hackathon for high school and college students on [[date]] and are looking for speakers
  * They students are very talented - this won't be a group of beginners
  * Give some examples of previous talks
  * Students often look to the speakers for advice, as well. If they have an extra hour or two to hang around, it's greatly appreciated.

If they're interested, reiterate the relevant details (time, date, location) and ask them what subject they're interested in talking about. Once you're done on the phone, send an email! Here's a template:

    Hey [name],

    I wanted to thank you again for agreeing to speak at CodeDay, a
    hackathon for high school and college students. I have you down on the
    schedule for [time] on [date] at [location]. I'm writing the title of
    your talk as [title] on the schedule, is that okay?

    When you're planning your talk, you should be aware of the fact that
    students are in the middle of developing games, and while the talks are
    extremely useful to them, they're often very impatient.

    As a result, we've found in the past that the talks work best when
    they're very interactive. As easy way to do this is to model it after
    a tutorial format.

    Thanks again for your help, and let me know if you have any questions.
    You can reach me here, or at [phone number].

    Cheers!

Pre-event Workshops?
--------------------
Some CodeDays hold pre-event workshops for "beginners". This helps bring in people who think they don't know how to code well enough to participate. (In reality, many of these people ended up winning past CodeDays.)

If you choose to hold pre-event workshops, you'll need to book additional speakers (unless you run them yourself), a venue, and do more promotion. These have traditionally been free, but if you have budget issues that may be more open.

The Keynote
-----------
In addition to getting speakers for the workshops, you'll also need someone to give the **keynote** - a brief talk at the beginning of CodeDay which sets the tone and inspires everyone. You'll want to make sure your speaker is relevant to your audience, and that they're aware of the intentions of the talk.

Judges
------
CodeDay is a competition, and a competition needs winners. A expert panel of judges goes a long way to boosting the legitimacy of the competition, and helps participants feel like they were treated fairly.

Judging panels at CodeDay are usually 3-5 people. Additionally, a volunteer usually sits in on the deliberation, to help the judges understand the criteria and to help where they may have questions. (Judging is covered in more detail later.)

Being a judge requires much less commitment than being a speaker, so you may have more success in getting highly qualified people.

The conversation with a potential judge should follow much the same format as with a potential speaker, except that you should stress the small time commitment necessary.

If you are having difficulty locating judges, you can ask speakers if they would be interested.

The following is an example of a confirmation email for a judge:

    Hey [name],

    I wanted to thank you again for agreeing to judge at CodeDay, a
    hackathon for high school and college students. As a reminder, the
    judging will be at [location] on [date] at [time]. Does that still
    work for you?

    You don't need to do any work beforehand, we will have instructions for
    you when you arrive.

    Thanks!

Sponsorships
------------
As resourceful as organizers are, CodeDay events are not *entirely* free to run.

Sponsors make for awesome CodeDay events. While they're commonly seen as a way of getting giveaway prizes (and they often do donate prizes), sponsors of CodeDay have also donated money, food, the venue (see previous section) and people (volunteers/judges/speakers).

When speaking with a business about sponsorship, you have to keep in mind that, while the employees may care about what you're doing, the business cares only about money.

The trick to landing a sponsorship is to convince them that not only is it the right thing to do, but it's also an *investment*. In most cases this is that the attendees are a potential talent pool for the company, but some companies might also be interested in extending their popularity among college and high school students (e.g. energy drink companies, social networks), or getting new developers to use their platform (i.e. any company which has a "developer evangelist").

When companies consider a sponsorship request, it's usually on the following basis:

  1. *Do they have the money?* Targeting extremely fresh startups is probably not worth the time.
  2. *Will this succees?* Luckly, CodeDay events already have a track-record of success, but it may still take some convincing that it will succeed in your city.
  3. *How big is the event?* More people almost always leads to more interest.


Who can you ask for sponsorship? Everyone! In the past, CodeDays have been sponsored by:

  * Large social networks
  * Large game studios
  * Tech Stores
  * Source Control companies
  * Game development framework companies
  * Small startups

The best way to get sponsorships is to find connections in your network to local companies with some relation to tech. Again, warm introductions are ideal, but cold calling is better than nothing, and works more than you might think.
