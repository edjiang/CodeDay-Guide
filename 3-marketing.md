#Marketing CodeDay

The single biggest task in planning a CodeDay is making sure people come. Students are skeptical, busy people, and it takes quite a bit of convincing to get them to leave what they're doing for an entire weekend, especially if this is the first CodeDay in the area.

**Promote early.** As soon as you have a venue and a date you should be promoting.

Here's a good roadmap for early promotion.

  1. Create events on Facebook, Meetup, and others. Make sure people know they need to get tickets from the CodeDay website. 

  2. Identify some community leaders. This means trend-setting students, club leaders, etc. Ask them to commit to attending CodeDay. Give them a free ticket if they promise to help you promote the event on Facebook/Twitter/etc. Having these students attend ensures that their friends and others that they inspire will attend as well. 

  3. Contact your friends. Go through your entire list of friends on Facebook, and message each one that you think are interested in programming, gaming, art, and entrepreneurship. 

  Make it clear why this is going to be amazing. Promotion works best early on when you have a group of people who love you so much that they convince other people to come as well.

  4. Find some Facebook groups and email lists to join, and promote it on there. Examples are: CS / Programming groups, CSTA (Computer Science Teachers Association) mailing lists, FIRST Robotics, Math clubs, etc. 

  5. Talk to local schools. Ask them to hand out flyers, and see if you can visit their classes to speak for 5 minutes.

  Emphasize the educational benefits, and see if they'll offer extra credit. Have them commit to a specific time they'll tell their students, and remind them of it. Teachers are often busy and may forget.

  6. Contact some local newspapers. They usually have contact information on their websites. 

  7. Post updates on social media sites every day until the event.
