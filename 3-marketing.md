How to Market a CodeDay

CodeDay is an incredible event for students to meet other students passionate about technology. Consequently, there also aren't many existing channels for you to reach students that are passionate about technology.

Finding and building a community of students excited about CodeDay will be the most difficult and time-consuming aspect of planning a CodeDay. At the same time, it's the most rewarding -- once you get to CodeDay and see the huge crowd, you know it's all worth it. 

#Strategy

For CodeDay, I'd encourage you to rely on a word-of-mouth based strategy. If you think about it, most students don't do this:

1. Get email or Facebook invite to CodeDay
2. Register & Attend

Instead, this is the typical flow:

1. A friend says "Hey, you should come to CodeDay with me! It's going to be really fun! :D"
2. Register & Attend

Your job as the marketer is to encourage these sorts of discussions among students, and build a community that's passionate about CodeDay. 

##The Typical Pitch

CodeDay is a relatively new event, and many students are unfamiliar with the format. This means that you'll need to pitch it in a different way to traditional events. That means, instead of:

>"Hey, want to come to CodeDay? It's a 24-hour programming marathon!"

>"Oh sorry, I'm not really interested in programming. 

It works better like this:

>"Hey, want to come to CodeDay? We're going to build apps and games in 24 hours!"

>"Oh, sounds interesting, but I don't know how to build an app or game. Is it even possible to build one in 24 hours?"

>"Oh yes, it's definitely possible -- StudentRND's been hosting these in Seattle with some really cool results. And it's OK if you don't know how. We have some workshops to help get you started, and part of the fun is learning as you go along, and being in this community with other passionate students!"

>"Sounds interesting, but I don't know anyone who's going..."

>"That's alright! When you get to the event, people with cool ideas pitch those ideas, then you form teams around people with the most interesting ideas. Many people form teams at the event -- and many bring friends as well!"

>"Ok, sounds like fun! I'll get a ticket!" 

#Getting Started

As soon as you secure your venue, you should start promoting CodeDay. Here's some things to get started with:

##Identify Key Influencers

The first step, is really to identify key influencers. These could be people in your school, and other schools that you know influence other students. (eg, if they do something, 5 other students do something). For example: 

* Club Presidents
* Leaders in different "friend groups"
* "Cool" teachers

Then, approach them and pitch CodeDay to them. Ask them to help you make CodeDay a success by attending, and encouraging their friends to attend. 

##Create a Facebook Event & Website

Of all social media, Facebook works the best for high school and college students. Start by creating a Facebook event. This could be on the StudentRND page (with the help of StudentRND staff), or on your personal wall. Make sure that you link to your CodeDay website!

Start by inviting your close friends (they *are* coming to CodeDay, aren't they?) and the influencers to join the event. After several people click "attending", go through your friends list and invite everyone you think would be interested. Ask your influencers and friends to do the same. That should start building some traction. 

##Facebook Groups

##Outreach to other organizations

 * clubs
 * Csta
 * schools
 * newspapers

  6. Contact some local newspapers. They usually have contact information on their websites. 

  7. Post updates on social media sites every day until the event.
