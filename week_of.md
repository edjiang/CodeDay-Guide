The Week Of
===========

Email
-----

Eventbrite will send a generic "two days until your event" email, but attendees often have questions beyond "what day is CodeDay", so it's best to set up your own, as well. You can do this from the "Attendees" -> "Email Attendees" menu in Eventbrite. We've found it's best to schedule this email for 16 hours before the event.

### Information to Include

 * What to bring
   * Computer
   * Sleeping bag
   * Whatever you need to succeed (e.g. monitors)
   * Software
   * Ideas
 * What technologies you should use
   * Beginners should make a game in Construct
   * Advanced teams can use whatever they want
 * Install dev tools before you go
 * Location
 * When the doors open
 * Parking
 * Event schedule overview
 * Check-in procedure

We've provided a template for this email at [resources/pre-event-email.html.txt](resources/pre-event-email.html.txt), just be sure to change everything in brackets!

### Confirmations

You'll also want to send emails to anyone important who you haven't talked to in a while. This includes sponsors, speakers, judges, and your contact for the venue. Remind them of the event, and what time they'll be expected to show up and what to bring.

You should also make arrangements for getting access to the venue for setup.

Badges
------

The easiest way to do check-in is by pre-printing badges for all your attendees the night before the event. Since this results in a 1:1 mapping between an attendee and a badge, there's no need to use Eventbrite's At The Door feature to track no-shows and prevent people from sneaking in.

Badges are also awesome because they help new people remember names of people they just met.

You can pick up a pack of self-adhesive "Hello My Name is" badges for around $5 at an office supply store.

Food
----

Call the food vendors, and order food with the help of StudentRND. Go to your local grocery store and get breakfast and drinks. 

Setup
-----

The night before the event, get a bunch of volunteers together and get the event ready!

Things which should be handled the night before:

 * Equipment move-in
 * Tables
 * Chairs
 * Power, if you're not in an office or other space meant for lots of computers
 * Wifi
 * Drinks
 * Food area
 * Check-in table and badges
 * Audio
 * Projector
