<h1>Is it really that time?!</h1>
<p>
    Yes, yes it is. Dearest attendees, we are less than one day out from our beloved festival of programming, CodeDay.
    Grab your friends, grab your laptops, and grab a ride, because it all starts tomorrow at noon!
</p>
<p>
    This email will tell you everything you need to know about tomorrow. If you have any other questions, you can reply
    to this email, or call us at (425) 780-7901.
</p>

<h1>What to Bring</h1>
<p>
    <strong>You don't need much, but you do need these things:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Laptop (or desktop <em>with wifi card</em>)</li>
    <li>Any software you need! <strong>Don't waste an hour of CodeDay downloading Visual Studio or X-Code!</strong></li>
    <li>Sleeping bag if you plan on sleeping</li>
    <li>Ideas (optional, but you should think about it anyway)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Install Dev Tools Now!</h1>
<p>
    Download and install whatever enviroments you plan on using <strong>today!</strong> This was mentioned in the last
    section, but still, every event at least a tenth of the participants waste hours downloading tools.
</p>
<p>
    Install your tools today so you're not at a disadvantage tomorrow!
</p>

<h1>What to Use</h1>
<p>
    <strong>Beginner teams!</strong> We strongly recommend making a game in Construct. There are lots of beginner-
    friendly tutorials online. [Plus, we'll be hosting workshops to help you get started.]
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Advanced teams!</strong> Use whatever you want! There aren't any limits on the technology or what you can
    build. (Well, there are a few. Check out <a href="http://[city].codeday.org/rules.html">the rules</a> to be sure.)
    Just remember, if you use something really odd, there's very little chance anyone on-hand will be able to help you.
</p>

<h1>Where to Go</h1>
<p>
    <strong>[Venue Name]</strong><br />
    [Venue St]<br />
    [Venu City], [Venue State] [Venue Zip]
</p>
<p>
    You do <strong>not</strong> need a ticket, we will check you in at the door by name.
</p>

[[[
<h1>Parking (don't do it!)</h1>
<p>
    [Venue] does not have any public parking! If you're planning on parking, you should arrive extra early so you can
    find on-street parking.
</p>
<p>
    Better yet, take a bus! Here are some common routes which would get you there in time:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>From [xyz]: Route [nnn] leaving at [nn:nn am]</li>
</ul>
]]]

<h1>Check-in</h1>
<p>
    Check-in starts at 11am. You do <strong>not</strong> need your tickets, we'll check you in by name. If you gave your
    tickets to someone else, please reply to this email posthaste so we can get him or her a proper badge.
</p>
<p>
    Have friends who want to go but didn't get tickets? Call us at (425) 780-7901 and we'll let you know if we turn out
    to have room.
</p>

<h1>Opening Ceremony</h1>
<p>
    The opening ceremony starts at 12 noon on the dot. Be there, you seriously won't want to miss it! After the keynote,
    everyone with an idea for a project will get a chance to go up to the front of the room and pitch it. Then you'll
    have some time to mingle, form a team around the ideas you like most, and then you can start coding!
</p>

<h1>Workshops</h1>
<p>
    The final list of workshops is on the CodeDay website! Quite often, people skip the workshops entirely. This is a
    <em>bad idea</em>. The workshops are almost always extremely useful! Check them out if you see one that interests
    you.

    We're looking forward to seeing you all tomorrow! Don't hesitate to call or email if you have any questions!
</p>

    Cheers,<br />
